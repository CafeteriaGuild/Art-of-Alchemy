# Art Of Alchemy Memoriam

On Friday, August 21st the Fabric community was notified that Amelia Rose, known to us as SynthRose, had tragically passed away. In the wake of that announcement, the community came together in unity and solidarity to remember SynthRose, her work, and her place in our community.

The goal of this mod is to allow SynthRose's memory to live on in her work, and to posthumously complete and maintain her contributions to the fabric modding community. There are no plans to change the fundamental core principles of the project, but to simply maintain what we believe to be SynthRose's original vision for the project.

As with all Cumulus mods, Art of Alchemy is a mod for Fabric and there are no plans to port this mod to Forge. However, this project is licensed under MIT, so you are welcome to do it yourself.

## Mod Requirements & Acknowledgments
To use this mod, you will need:

* Minecraft 1.16
* The [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod loader
* The [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

This project uses CottonMC's [LibGUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/libgui) library. You do not need to install it seperately to play the mod.

## The World of Alchemy
At the heart of alchemy is the practice of transmutation. The ability to transmute substances into other, more useful substances is a valuable skill for any would-be crafter, and it starts with understanding the world around us. Our world is fundamentally made of two things: materia and essentia.

Materia is the physical material that all objects are made from. Although in principle all matter is interchangeable, in practice an alchemist will obtain poorer-quality materia from more common items, and richer materia from rare items. Thus, materia comes in seven grades, from F rank through to A and S rank. There are rumors of an eighth "omega" rank, but no concrete evidence of such a thing has ever surfaced.

Essentia, on the other hand, is the metaphysical essence of an object. You can't interact with it directly; when not bound within an object, it must be dissolved into solution. There are thirteen known types of essentia in this world, which have been named after the eight planets, plus Apollo (the Sun), Diana (the Moon), the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and the mysterious Void.

Materia gives essentia substance, and essentia gives materia form. By breaking substances down into these two elements and recombining them in different ways, new substances can be formed.

## Alchemical Machinery
There are three core devices that alchemists make heavy use of in their work. They are the Calcination Furnace, Dissolution Chamber, and Synthesis Table. The Calcination Furnace uses solid fuel (the same sort you'd use in a regular furnace) to burn off the essentia within a substance, leaving behind only materia. The Dissolution Chamber does the reverse, using alkahest (the universal solvent) to break down the materia of a substance and leave its essentia in solution. Finally, the materia and essentia can be recombined in a Synthesis Table with a small sample of a desired substance to create more of the catalyst substance.

## Questions & Answers

**Can you port this mod to Forge?**
We will not be porting this mod to forge, nor will we officially support any ports to the forge modding platform. We maintain and develop this mod in our limited free time. For us it makes more sense to work on adding more feature into the mod than maintaining two versions of it. That being said, this project is licensed under the MIT license meaning if you so desire, you can freely port the mod to forge, but you will not get our official support in any capacity. For more information on why we have this policy please read [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Vaerian/12b5e8afe1593bf07ea672ed208ac617).

**Can you update the mod to the latest version?**
In most cases the mod ought to be updated to the latest version, however, if it is not, be assured that we are working hard in order to update as soon as possible. Unfortunately, however, that often takes a little bit of time. Alternatively, if you'd like to contribute towards updating, feel free to make a [pull request](https://github.com/Cumulus-Mods/Art-of-Alchemy/pulls) and we'll be sure look over it.

**I have a cool idea for a feature. Can you add it?**
We make no guarantees about whether or not your idea will make it into the project, however, making a request on the [issues page](https://github.com/Cumulus-Mods/Art-of-Alchemy/issues) is the best way to get our attention. We'll make sure to read through your idea, evaluate whether or not we feel it fits within the scope of the project, and then if we like your idea, we'll add it into the project.

**I found a bug. Can you fix it?**
Submit a request on the [issues page](https://github.com/Cumulus-Mods/Art-of-Alchemy/issues) and We'll make sure to take a look at it and do as much as we can in order to fix the issue. It also helps if you provide a crash log, or some more details about what specific behavior is buggy.
