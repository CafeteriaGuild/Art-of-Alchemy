# Essentia
Essentia, on the other hand, is the metaphysical essence of an object. You can't interact with it directly - when not bound within an object, essentia must be dissolved into [[Alkahest]]. There are thirteen known types of essentia in this world, which have been named after the celestial spheres. Each type is associated with a certain astrological category and elemental category, which determine how they are separated by the [[Astrological Centrifuge|Centrifuges]] and [[Elemental Centrifuge|Centrifuges]].

Essentia can be created in a [[Dissolution Chamber]] using [[Alkahest]]. The creative inventory also contains essentia buckets, which can be used to place essentia in the world - however, they are not obtainable in survival mode at this time.

Essentia can be kept in an item with an [[Essentia Vessel]], stored in the world using an [[Essentia Tank]], and transported between blocks using [[Essentia Conduits]].
