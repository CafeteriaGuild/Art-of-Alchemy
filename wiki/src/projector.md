# Projection Altar
The Projection Altar allows you to concentrate materia to higher ranks using [[Alkahest]]. It takes 8 materia of a lower rank to create 1 materia of a higher rank; the amount of alkahest required increases as the materia rank does.

With default recipes, the Projection Altar is only available after creating the [[Philosopher's Stone]].
