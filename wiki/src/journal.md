# Alchemical Journal
The Alchemical Journal allows you to store an unlimited number of [[formulas|Formula]] in a single item. To use, just open it up and insert any formulas you want to save into the slot in the top left. Those formulas will then appear in the searchable list. Clicking the checkbox next to any entry will select that as the active entry for this journal; you can then place the journal in a [[Synthesis Table]] in place of a regular target to transmute that selection. Clicking the box in the top right will clear the selection. You can also place the journal in an [[Analysis Desk]] to create a copy of the selected formula.

### Crafting Recipe

The Alchemical Journal can by crafted by shapelessly combining one book with one [Azoth](./Azoth.md) in a crafting table as follows.
