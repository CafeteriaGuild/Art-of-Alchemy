# Synthesis Table
The Synthesis Table allows you to combine [[essentia]] and [[materia]] into useful substances, provided you already have a sample or formula to work from. With the basic version, only items up to rank C can be synthesized.

To use, fill the table with essentia using an [[Essentia Vessel]], place materia in the top slot, and place an item to be copied in the bottom "target" slot. You can also use a [[Formula]] in place of the target. More of the substance in the target slot will be transmuted. For certain items, like liquids, you may need to place a container in the output slot to be filled.

Normally, hoppers can insert items into the materia slot from the top and into the target slot from the side, and pull from the output slot on the button. However, while the Synthesis Table is receiving redstone power, hoppers can pull from the target slot as well, and the side input switches to the output slot (to allow inserting containers). Dispensers can be used with Essentia Vessels to automate essentia extraction and insertion.

With default recipes, the Synthesis Table can be upgraded using a [[Philosopher's Stone]]. In addition to improving the speed and tank capacity, this allows you to transmute with all ranks of materia.

### Crafting Table

The base Synthesis Table is crafting by combining six Nether Quartz, two [[Azoth]], and one Smithing Table together in a crafting grid as follows.
