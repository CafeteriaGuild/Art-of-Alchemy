# Centrifuges
Centrifuges separate mixtures of [[Essentia]]. There are two types - the Astral Centrifuge, and the Elemental Centrifuge. Either way, essentia is inserted into the top or bottom of the block, and the separated contents are output to the four cardinal directions. Complicating matters is the fact that multiple essentia are routed to each face; a complete separation system would require multiple centrifuges, though it is possible, since each essentia has a unique combination of astral and elemental attributes. Of course, a clever alchemist will limit the inputs to their system so that they can get away with less sorting.

The Astrological Centrifuge separates essentia into:
* (Α) Inner Planets, consisting of Mercury, Venus, Tellus, and Mars
* (Β) Outer Planets, consisting of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
* (Γ) Other Bodies, consisting of Ceres, Pluto, Apollo, and Diana
* (Ξ) The Firmament, including only Void


The Elemental Centrifuge separates essentia into:
* (🜂) Fire, consisting of Mars, Jupiter, and Apollo
* (🜁) Air, consisting of Venus, Uranus, and Pluto
* (🜄) Water, consisting of Mercury, Neptune, and Diana
* (🜃) Earth, consisting of Tellus, Saturn, and Ceres

Void essentia, associated with the Ether, is not processed.

### Crafting Recipes

#### Elemental Centrifuge

The Elemental Centrifuge is crafted by combining two Nether Quartz, four Gold Ingots, two Redstone Dust, and one Polished Basalt.

#### Astral Centrifuge

The Astral Centrifuge is crafted similarly to the Elemental Centrifuge, but by using Lapis Lazuli instead of Redstone Dust.
