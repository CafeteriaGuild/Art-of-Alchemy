# Dissolution Chamber
The Dissolution Chamber allows you to dissolve away the materia of a substance into [[Alkahest]], leaving the [[essentia]] in solution. With the basic version, only half of the essentia is recovered.

To use, fill the chamber using with buckets of [[Alkahest]], and then place the substance to be dissolved in the left slot. The essentia needs to be transferred out using an [[Essentia Vessel]].

Hoppers can insert items to be dissolved into the top of the block, and pull any containers left over from the bottom. Alkahest can be automatically added using a dispenser with an alkahest bucket. Essentia can be automatically removed using an essentia vessel in a dispenser.

With default recipes, the Dissolution Chamber can be upgraded using a [[Philosopher's Stone]]. In addition to improving the speed and tank size, this allows you to recover the full amount of essentia within an item.

### Crafting Recipe
