# Conduits
Essentia conduits are pipes that allow you to automatically transfer [[Essentia]] between alchemical machines. Essentia ports can be placed on Essentia Conduits between the machine and the conduit itself in order to change the functionality of the input or output.

For the purposes of explanation the term "Alchemical Machine" refers to any block that can accept or supply essentia, even things that are not typically considered machines such as the [[Essentia Tank]].

A basic Essentia Port is required in order to connect an Essentia Conduit to any alchemical machine. The basic Essentia Port is lazy meaning it won't automatically push or pull by itself.

The Pressurized Essentia Port is required in order to pull Essentia out of an Alchemical Machine. By placing the Pressurized Essentia Port between an Essentia Conduit and an alchemical machine it will pull essentia out of the alchemical machine and push it into the nearest alchemical machine connected by either a Basic or Evacuated Essentia Port.

The Evacuated Essentia Port works as the inverse of the Pressurized Essentia Port. Instead of pulling essentia out of its corresponding alchemical machine, the Evacuated Essentia Port pulls essentia from all other alchemical machines on the network connected by either a Basic or Pressurized Essentia Port, and places the essentia in the alchemical machine it is connected to.
