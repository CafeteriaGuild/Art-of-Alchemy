# Materia
Materia is the physical material that all objects are made from. Although in principle all matter is interchangeable, in practice an alchemist will obtain poorer-quality materia from more common items, and richer materia from rare items. Thus, materia comes in seven grades:

* **S Rank** (e.g. Nether Stars, Netherite)
* **A Rank** (e.g. Diamonds, Emeralds)
* **B Rank** (e.g. Gold Ingots, Lapis Lazuli)
* **C Rank** (e.g. Iron Ingots, Redstone)
* **D Rank** (e.g. Coal, Bone)
* **E Rank** (e.g. Wood, Netherrack)
* **F Rank** (e.g. Cobblestone, Dirt)

There are rumors of an eighth **Ω Rank**, but no such a substance has never been isolated. <sup>[1]</sup> Two pieces of materia can be mixed in a crafting table to get two pieces of their average rank, rounded down. There is no known method of upgrading materia.

Materia can be created in a [[Calcination Furnace]] by burning solid fuel.

<sup>[1]</sup> Ω-Rank Materia exists for modders, modpack developers, and anyone wanting to add their own recipes. There are no plans to use it for vanilla items.
