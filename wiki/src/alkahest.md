# Alkahest
Alkahest is the universal solvent, used in the [Dissolution Chamber](./dissolver.md) to dissolve substances into essentia.

Alkahest can be placed in the world, where it will damage any entities that touch it.

Alkahest can be automatically inserted into machines that use it by placing Buckets of Alkahest in a dispenser pointed at the machine.

### Crafting Recipe

Alkahest can be crafted one of two ways. Either by dissolving [Azoth](./azoth.md) itself in a solution of water, or combining the component parts of [Azoth](./azoth.md) in a solution of water.
