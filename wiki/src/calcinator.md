# Calcination Furnace
The Calcination Furnace allows you to burn off the essence of a substance using solid fuel, leaving behind only [[materia]]. With the basic version, only half of the materia is recovered.

To use, place fuel in the bottom slot and the item to be burned in the top slot. The materia will be output in the right slot.

Hoppers can insert items to be burned into the top of the block, insert fuel into the side, and pull output from the bottom.

With default recipes, the Calcination Furnace can be upgraded using a [[Philosopher's Stone]]. In addition to improving the speed and fuel efficiency, this allows you to recover the full amount of materia within an item.

### Crafting Recipe

The base level of Calcination Furnace can be crafted by combining six nether quartz, a furnace, and two azoth in a crafting grid as follows.
