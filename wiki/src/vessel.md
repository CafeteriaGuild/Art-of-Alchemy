# Vessel
An Essentia Vessel allows you to transport [[essentia]] between machines, or store it for later use.

To use a vessel, just hold it and press the use key on a block you wish to pull essentia from or push essentia to. You can change a vessel's input/output settings by sneaking while pressing the use key. Essentia Vessels can also be used by Dispensers.

### Crafting Recipe

The Essentia Vessel can be crafted by combining a Bucket, two Glass, one Gold Ingot, two Nether Quartz, and one [[Azoth]] together in a crafting grid as follows
