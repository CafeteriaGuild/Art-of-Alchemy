# Analysis Desk
The Analysis Desk allows you to create formulae for use in the [Synthesis Table](./synthesizer.md), obviating the need to keep a copy of every item you want to be able to transmute on hand. 

To use, place paper in the left slot, ink in the top slot, and the item you want to create a formula of in the bottom slot. You can then pull formulas out of the output slot.

Unlike most machines, the Analysis Desk does not have an upgraded version.
